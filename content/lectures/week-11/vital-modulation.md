title: "Modulation in Vital"

### What is Modulation?

Modulation is the process of changing a parameter over time to add dynamics and interest to a sound. In Vital Synth, you can use modulation to control almost any parameter, like pitch, filter cutoff, wavetable position, or amplitude. Vital’s modulation system allows you to easily drag and drop to assign modulators to any parameter, making it intuitive and powerful for sound design.

### Getting Started with LFOs in Vital

LFOs are a key element in synthesis, adding cyclic or repetitive changes to a sound. They operate at a low frequency (hence the name) and can be routed to any parameter in Vital to add rhythmic movement. Here’s how to start using LFOs in Vital.

1. **Select an LFO:** In Vital, you have several LFOs available on the right side of the interface. Choose one by clicking on it.

2. **Choose an LFO Shape:** LFOs in Vital come with various wave shapes like sine, triangle, saw, and square. Each shape influences the modulation in a unique way:
   - **Sine Waves** create smooth, cyclical changes, great for vibrato or gentle pulsing.
   - **Square Waves** switch the parameter on and off, perfect for stutter or tremolo effects.
   - **Saw Waves** can create a rise and fall effect, adding dramatic movement.

3. **Adjust the LFO Rate:** The rate controls how fast the LFO cycles. Higher rates create faster modulation (great for tremolo effects), while lower rates create slower, more subtle changes.

### Modulating Filter Cutoff with an LFO

Let’s walk through using an LFO to modulate the filter cutoff in Vital, creating a bass sound with a rhythmic movement.

1. **Set Up a Simple Bass Patch:** Start with a basic saw or square waveform on Oscillator 1, then apply a low-pass filter to cut off the higher frequencies.

2. **Assign the LFO to the Filter Cutoff:**
   - Click and drag from the LFO label to the filter cutoff knob.
   - You’ll see a blue ring around the knob, indicating the depth of modulation.
   - Adjust the modulation depth by clicking on the blue ring and dragging in or out to control how much the LFO affects the cutoff.

3. **Experiment with LFO Rate and Shape:**
   - Try setting a slow rate (around 0.5 Hz) with a sine wave to create a smooth, pulsing bass.
   - Increase the rate to around 2-5 Hz to hear a faster, wobble-like movement.

4. **Fine-Tune the LFO Settings:** In Vital, you can sync the LFO to your DAW’s tempo, creating rhythmic modulation that aligns with your project’s BPM. Experiment with free-running and synced modes to find the right feel for your bass.

### Introducing Modulation Envelopes

While LFOs create repetitive modulation, modulation envelopes can shape the sound over time, perfect for one-shot effects like filter sweeps. Vital allows you to create custom envelopes and assign them just like LFOs.

1. **Set Up a Modulation Envelope:** In the same section as the LFOs, select an envelope and shape it using the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) settings. For instance:
   - **Attack** controls how quickly the envelope reaches its peak.
   - **Decay** sets how fast it falls after reaching that peak.
   - **Sustain** keeps the parameter steady until the note is released.
   - **Release** determines how long it takes to return to zero.

2. **Apply the Envelope to a Parameter:** Let’s assign a modulation envelope to control the wavetable position for a smooth, evolving sound.
   - Drag the envelope to the wavetable position knob.
   - Adjust the envelope shape to control the movement of the wavetable position over the length of the note.

### In-Class Project: Designing a Modulated Bass Sound

Now that you’ve learned about LFOs and modulation envelopes, it’s time to apply them to a bass sound! Follow these steps to create a modulated bass patch using what we covered.

1. **Choose Your Oscillator Waveform:** Start with a saw or square wave for a strong bass foundation.
   
2. **Set Up a Low-Pass Filter:** Apply a low-pass filter to remove high frequencies and create a warm, focused sound.

3. **Add an LFO to the Filter Cutoff:** Drag an LFO to the filter cutoff knob and adjust the rate for a pulsing effect. Experiment with different shapes (like sine or saw) to see how each changes the feel of the bass.

4. **Apply an Envelope to the Wavetable Position (Optional):** Use a modulation envelope to move the wavetable position, adding subtle shifts to the tone over the duration of the note.

5. **Experiment and Adjust:** Play around with the modulation depth and rates to make the sound your own. Try adjusting the filter cutoff and resonance to shape the character of the bass.
