# Using the Adaptive Grid Tool in REAPER's MIDI Editor

For MIDI editing in REAPER, the **Adaptive Grid Tool** is a great addition. It gives you the flexibility to quickly adjust the grid in the MIDI editor, which can be incredibly helpful for fine-tuning your MIDI edits. Plus, you can add it directly to the MIDI toolbar for quick access!

Here’s how to set it up and use it:

### Setting Up the Adaptive Grid Tool for MIDI Editing

1. **Install the Tool via ReaPack**:
   - If you haven’t already, you’ll need ReaPack. It’s a plugin manager for REAPER that lets you easily install and update scripts.
   - Open **Extensions > ReaPack > Import a repository** and paste the following URL:
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iliaspoulakis/Reaper-Tools/master/index.xml
     ```
   - This will add the Adaptive Grid Tool to your REAPER setup.

2. **Selecting Your Grid Mode for MIDI**:
   - Open the Adaptive Grid Tool’s menu in REAPER, where you’ll see five modes: Narrowest, Narrow, Medium, Wide, and Widest.
   - Choose a mode that fits your MIDI workflow. You can experiment with different settings to see which grid size works best.

3. **Adding the Tool to Your MIDI Toolbar**:
   - To make this tool even easier to access, add each mode to your MIDI toolbar.
   - Go to **Options > Customize Toolbars/Buttons**, select the **MIDI toolbar**, and search for the Adaptive Grid actions.
   - Add each mode you’d like to have in your MIDI editor, and save your changes.

Now, you can quickly switch grid sizes while working on MIDI without going back and forth between menus. This setup should make your MIDI editing more efficient and responsive.
