# Effects and Post-processing

## Complete Guide to Using the Effects Tab in Vital Synth

The **Effects Tab** in Vital Synth is where you can shape, polish, and transform your sounds. With a variety of effects like Chorus, Compressor, Delay, Distortion, EQ, Filter, Flanger, Phaser, and Reverb, you have all the tools to create rich, dynamic soundscapes. This guide breaks down each effect in detail and offers practical tips to help you get the most out of your patches.

### Accessing the Effects Tab

To open the **Effects Tab**, simply click on "EFFECTS" at the top of Vital’s interface. Here, you can add multiple effects, reorder them, and adjust their parameters to shape the sound exactly as you want. Each effect has its own set of controls that can be tweaked to suit your creative vision.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Effect

#### 1. Chorus
- **Purpose**: The Chorus effect adds depth and richness to the sound by creating delayed copies of the original signal, which are then slightly detuned. This creates the illusion of multiple voices, adding thickness and dimension.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Voices**: Sets the number of additional voices. Adding more voices creates a thicker, more complex chorus effect.
  - **Frequency**: Adjusts the modulation speed of the chorus effect, determining how fast the pitch of each voice varies.
  - **Depth**: Controls the extent of pitch modulation applied to the voices, affecting the width of the effect.
  - **Delay 1 & Delay 2**: Sets the delay time for each voice, impacting the stereo width and spacing of the voices.
  - **Feedback and Mix**: The Feedback control intensifies the effect by feeding the delayed signal back into the chorus, creating a swirling motion, while Mix adjusts the balance between the dry and effected signals.
- **Practical Use**: Use Chorus to make a sound feel wider and more spacious. It works particularly well on pads and leads to add warmth and depth.

#### 2. Compressor
- **Purpose**: The Compressor controls the dynamic range of the sound by balancing out volume differences, making softer sounds louder and limiting peaks.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Mode**: The Multiband compressor divides the signal into low, mid, and high-frequency bands, allowing you to compress each range separately.
  - **Mix**: Adjusts how much compression is applied to the signal, blending the compressed and dry sounds.
  - **Low, Band, High**: These controls let you set the amount of compression applied to each frequency band, so you can enhance certain parts of the spectrum.
  - **Attack and Release**: Attack controls how quickly the compressor responds to loud sounds, and Release sets how long it takes to stop affecting the sound after it dips below the threshold.
- **Practical Use**: The Compressor is useful for balancing sounds, particularly in patches with wide dynamic ranges. Using Multiband mode allows you to control specific frequency areas without affecting the entire sound.

#### 3. Delay
- **Purpose**: Delay creates echoes or repetitions of the sound, adding a sense of depth, rhythm, and space.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Frequency**: Controls the delay time in musical subdivisions (e.g., 1/8 for eighth notes).
  - **Mode**: Choose between Mono and Stereo delays. Stereo mode makes the delays sound fuller and more immersive.
  - **Feedback**: Determines how many times the delay repeats. Higher feedback creates longer, more pronounced echoes.
  - **Mix**: Adjusts the balance between the delayed signal and the original sound.
  - **Cutoff and Spread**: The Cutoff filter shapes the tonal color of the delay, and Spread determines how wide the delay appears in the stereo field.
- **Practical Use**: Delay can create anything from subtle echoes to intense, rhythmic repetitions. Use lower feedback for subtle ambience or crank it up for longer, more rhythmic effects.

#### 4. Distortion
- **Purpose**: Distortion adds harmonics by clipping the signal, making it more aggressive and textured. It’s ideal for adding grit or warmth to a sound.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Type**: Select from different distortion types (e.g., Soft Clip) to change the character of the distortion.
  - **Drive**: Controls the intensity of the distortion effect. Higher drive creates more aggressive, saturated sounds.
  - **Mix**: Adjusts the amount of distortion applied to the signal.
  - **Cutoff, Resonance, and Blend**: Shape the tone of the distortion by controlling the cutoff frequency, resonance, and blending between wet and dry signals.
- **Practical Use**: Distortion is great for making sounds more aggressive, particularly basses and leads. It can also add warmth to softer sounds like pads when used subtly.

#### 5. EQ
- **Purpose**: EQ (Equalizer) balances frequencies, allowing you to shape the overall tonal character by boosting or cutting certain frequencies.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Low, Band, and High Gain**: Adjust the gain for low, mid, and high frequencies, which helps you emphasize or reduce specific parts of the sound.
  - **Cutoff and Resonance**: Control the frequency range and intensity of each adjustment.
- **Practical Use**: Use EQ to tailor the tonal balance of a sound, whether for a subtle boost or a more dramatic reshaping of frequencies.

#### 6. Filter
- **Purpose**: Filters shape the sound by allowing certain frequencies to pass while cutting others, letting you remove or emphasize specific frequency ranges.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Mode**: Selects the filter type, such as Analog 12dB, which changes the slope and character of the filter.
  - **Drive**: Adds saturation to the filter, making the sound warmer and more harmonically rich.
  - **Mix**: Adjusts the blend of the filtered and unfiltered signals.
  - **Key Tracking (Key Trk)**: Links the filter cutoff to pitch, making the filter frequency rise and fall with the notes.
- **Practical Use**: Filters are useful for sweeping through frequencies, especially with modulation, which adds movement to the sound.

#### 7. Flanger
- **Purpose**: A Flanger creates a "whooshing" effect by adding a delayed version of the signal, modulating over time. This effect can add depth and a sense of movement.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Frequency**: Controls the modulation speed, determining how quickly the sweep occurs.
  - **Offset**: Adjusts the stereo phase offset, creating a wider, more immersive effect.
  - **Feedback**: Adds resonance to the effect, intensifying the sweeping sound.
  - **Center and Depth**: Center adjusts the flanger's focus frequency, and Depth controls the range of modulation.
- **Practical Use**: Use Flanger on pads, leads, or basses to add texture and make sounds feel alive with subtle movement.

#### 8. Phaser
- **Purpose**: The Phaser shifts the signal’s phase in multiple frequency bands, creating a "spacey" or "liquid" sound.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Frequency**: Sets the rate of phase modulation.
  - **Offset**: Creates a stereo effect by adjusting phase differences between channels.
  - **Feedback**: Adds sharpness to the phased effect, increasing its intensity.
  - **Center and Depth**: Control the frequency range and depth of modulation.
- **Practical Use**: Phasers work well for adding movement to sounds, especially on pads or atmospheric textures.

#### 9. Reverb
- **Purpose**: Reverb simulates an acoustic space, giving depth and a sense of environment to the sound.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Pre Low Cut and Pre High Cut**: These filters control the frequencies that enter the reverb, useful for removing muddiness or harshness.
  - **Cutoff**: Shapes the frequencies within the reverb tail, emphasizing certain tonal areas.
  - **Chorus Amount and Frequency**: Adds a subtle modulation within the reverb, making it sound richer.
  - **Size and Time**: Adjust the size of the space and the decay time of the reverb tail.
- **Practical Use**: Reverb is great for adding spatial depth. Short reverb times can make sounds intimate, while longer times create an expansive feel.

### Creative Tips for Combining Effects

- **Filter + Reverb**: Use a low-pass filter to smooth high frequencies before adding reverb, creating a warm, atmospheric effect.
- **Flanger + Phaser**: Layer these for complex motion. Set one at a slow rate and the other faster for a more dynamic texture.
- **Reverb + Delay**: Add delay before reverb for rhythmic echoes that blend into ambient space, especially effective for soundscapes.

### Modulation and Automation
Vital’s modulation options allow you to make effects dynamic. Assign an LFO to the **Filter Cutoff** or **Delay Time** to keep the sound evolving over time.

### Stereo Width and Depth
Experiment with **Offset** and **Spread** controls on Flanger, Phaser, and Reverb to make sounds more immersive, perfect for cinematic or ambient patches.
