### Setup

1. Add the following effects to your project. Each effect can be placed on a different track. Make sure the effects are deactivated or unchecked at the start:

   - **ReaEQ**
   - **ReaPitch**
   - **ReaVerb**
   - **ReaVerbate**

2. There will be seven rounds, with each round having a decreasing time limit.
3. For each round, spin the wheel to choose a random effect, and activate the selected effect on your track. You will have the allotted time to experiment with the effect.
4. Repeat this for every round, activating only the effect chosen in that round.

### Game Rounds
