[Cheatsheet](../musicfrequencycheatsheet.pdf)

**Objective**: Use EQ in Reaper to manipulate specific frequency ranges in a full-spectrum track from Looperman, referencing the **Music Instrument Frequency Cheatsheet** for guidance.

### Instructions:

**Find a Three Loops**:

- Go to Looperman and search for tracks that includes combinations of instruments. Look for tracks in these catagories, or similar:
    - *drum and bass* or *funk*
    - *acoustic* or *singer-songwriter*
    - *rock* or *metal*
- Download the tracks and import them into Reaper.

**Open ReaEQ**:

- In Reaper, click on the FX button on your loop track and add **ReaEQ** from the plugin list.

**Use the Frequency Cheatsheet**:
 
 - Refer to the **Music Instrument Frequency Cheatsheet** to identify common frequency ranges for different instruments. For example:
   - **Bass Guitar**: Try boosting in the 50-100 Hz range to add "weight" or "growl."
   - **Kick Drum**: Experiment with boosting around 100 Hz for "punch" or cutting around 300-500 Hz to reduce "boxiness."
   - **Vocals**: Cut around 200-500 Hz to reduce "muddiness," or boost around 2-5 kHz for "presence."
   
 **Manipulate the Frequencies**:
 
 - Using the frequency ranges from the cheatsheet, experiment with boosting or cutting certain frequencies in ReaEQ:
   - Boost the low-end frequencies (20-200 Hz) to emphasize bass or kick drum.
   - Reduce the mid frequencies (200 Hz-2 kHz) to create more space between instruments.
   - Boost the high frequencies (5 kHz and above) to bring out clarity in vocals or cymbals.

**Compare**:
 
 - Toggle the EQ on and off to compare your adjusted version with the original. Listen to how each change impacts the sound and the balance between different instruments.

**Reflection**:
 
- Write a short reflection or prepare to discuss how each EQ adjustment changed the sound of the loop. How did the frequency boosts or cuts affect the different instruments, and which adjustments were most effective?
