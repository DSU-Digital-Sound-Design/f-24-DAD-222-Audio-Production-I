## What is Reaper?
Reaper is a digital audio workstation (DAW) known for its flexibility and customizability. Unlike other DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic Pro, or Ableton Live, Reaper allows you to customize nearly every aspect of its interface, including key commands, menus, toolbars, and mouse behaviors.


{{% note %}}

One of the most unique features of Reaper compared to other DAWs, such as Pro Tools, Logic Pro, or Ableton Live, is that everything is customizable, including key commands, menus, toolbars, and mouse behaviors. Reaper has reasonable defaults, so you don't have to worry about customizing everything immediately.

## You Try 

> Find a few random sounds from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) and import them. Notice how the track name changes to match the item name. As you drag in clips, notice how the items snap to the grid. If this doesn't happen, make sure you have snapping turned on.
