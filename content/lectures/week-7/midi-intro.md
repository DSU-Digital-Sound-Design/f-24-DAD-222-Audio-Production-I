## Setting Up MIDI

1. **Insert a New Track**: In Reaper, insert a new track and select "Insert virtual instrument on new track" when prompted. This will create a track with MIDI as the input.
2. **Connect Your MIDI Keyboard**: If you're using a MIDI keyboard, plug it in and enable it in Reaper's preferences under MIDI Devices. Once enabled, your keyboard will appear as a MIDI input for your tracks.
3. **Use Reaper's Virtual MIDI Keyboard**: If you don't have a physical MIDI keyboard, you can use Reaper's Virtual MIDI Keyboard by going to `View -> Virtual MIDI Keyboard`. This allows you to trigger MIDI notes directly from your computer keyboard.
4. **Verify MIDI Input**: Look for yellow meters on the track input to confirm that MIDI input is being received.

## Working with Sitala

> Find two loops from Looperman for this example: one should be a drum loop and the other a bass sound.

1. **Add Sitala to the Track**: Add Sitala to your newly created track.
2. **Load a Bass Loop**: Import the bass loop into an instance of Sitala.
3. **Trigger the Sample**: Use your MIDI keyboard to trigger the bass sample and play notes.
4. **Record a MIDI Loop**:
   1. Arm the track for recording by pressing the Record Arm button.
   1. Record a MIDI loop and then double-click the MIDI item to open it in the MIDI editor.
   1. In the editor, create a loop and use the `Record: MIDI/Overdub Replace` function.
5. **Editing MIDI Notes**: In the MIDI editor, you can drag notes to adjust their position or create new ones using the Pencil tool.

## Quantizing MIDI Notes

1. **Quantize Your Recording**: Click the **Q** button to quantize your MIDI recording, aligning the notes to the grid.
2. **Adjust Settings**: Adjust the quantization settings to fit the desired timing.
3. **Commit the Changes**: If the quantized result sounds good, commit the changes to make them permanent.
4. **Experiment with Different Grid Sizes**: Try different grid sizes, like triplets or swing, for more creative rhythmic variations.

## Adding More Tracks

1. **Add Another Track for Drums**: Create an additional track with another instance of Sitala for drums.
2. **Assign Samples to Different Notes**: Load different drum samples into Sitala and assign each one to a separate note by adjusting the Note Start and End knobs.
3. **Use MIDI Overdub Recording**: Use the MIDI Overdub recording mode to layer drum patterns over multiple recording passes.
