# Midi Intro in Reaper

> Download the Sitala plugin: [old version](https://decomposer.de/sitala/#downloads)

## Setup

1. Insert a new track and select "Insert virtual instrument on new track" when prompted. This will create a track with MIDI as the input.
2. If using a MIDI keyboard, plug it in and enable it in Reaper's preferences under MIDI Devices. The keyboard will now show up as a MIDI input for your tracks.
3. If no MIDI keyboard, use Reaper's Virtual MIDI Keyboard under View -> Virtual MIDI Keyboard. This allows you to trigger MIDI notes from your computer keyboard.
4. Look for yellow meters on the track input to verify MIDI input is working.

## Sitala 

> Find two loops from looperman for this example. One should be drums and one should be a bass sound. 

1. Add Sitalia to the new track. 
2. Add the bass loop to an instance of Sitalia 
3. Play notes on the MIDI keyboard and the sample will trigger.
4. Record a MIDI loop using the Record Arm button. Double click the MIDI item to open the MIDI editor.
   1. Create a loop 
   2. Use Record: MIDI/Overdub Replace 
5. In the editor, notes can be edited by dragging. Create new notes with the Pencil tool.

## Quantization

1. Click the Q button to quantize the recording. Adjust settings to taste.
2. Commit the changes to make quantization permanent if it sounds good.
3. Try different grid sizes like triplet or swing for creative results.

## Adding more tracks

1. Add another track with Sitalia for drums.
2. Add each drum sample to a different note by setting Note Start and End knobs.
3. Use MIDI Overdub recording mode to build up drum pattern over multiple passes.
