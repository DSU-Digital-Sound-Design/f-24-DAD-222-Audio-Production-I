## Introduction 

* **Sampling, mash-ups, and remixes** are all musical techniques that involve the reuse of existing recordings.
* Increasingly popular in recent decades, thanks to advances in digital technology.
* Use has been controversial at times, but others argue that it is a creative form of expression that should be protected.

## Early History - Jazz

The earliest examples of sampling can be traced back to the early 20th century, when jazz musicians began to incorporate snippets of other recordings into their live performances. This practice, known as "borrowing" or "quoting," was seen as a way to pay homage to fellow musicians and to add new and unexpected elements to their own music.

In the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed a new genre of music called musique concrète, which involved manipulating recorded sounds to create new compositions. Schaeffer used a variety of techniques, including sampling, to create his music, and his work is considered to be one of the earliest examples of electronic music.

## Musique Concrète Techniques

* **Splicing**: Cutting and rearranging tape to reorder audio.  
* **Looping**: Creating repeating patterns of sound from tape recordings.  
* **Reverse Playback**: Playing sounds backward for new effects.  
* **Speed Manipulation**: Changing the speed of a recording to alter pitch and timbre.
* **Filtering**: Using EQ to remove or emphasize certain frequencies.
* **Reverb**: Adding artificial reverb to create a sense of space.

## The Rise of Hip Hop

{{% note %}}

The first commercial samplers were released in the late 1970s, and they quickly became popular among hip hop artists. DJs began using samplers to create new beats by isolating and looping drum breaks and other instrumental passages from existing recordings. This technique, known as breakbeat sampling, played a vital role in the development of hip hop music.

## Comparing Musique Concrète and Early Hip Hop Sampling

---

### Source Material

- **Musique Concrète**: Used recorded **environmental sounds** like trains, speech, and ambient noise.
- **Early Hip Hop**: Sampled **musical recordings** like drum breaks, funk, and soul tracks to create rhythmic grooves.

{{% note %}}
Musique concrète used non-musical sounds to create abstract compositions, while hip hop repurposed musical sounds to create new rhythms for songs.
{{%/ note %}}

---

### Manipulation Techniques

- **Musique Concrète**: Techniques like **splicing, looping, pitch-shifting**, and **reversing** sounds on tape, transforming them into abstract soundscapes.
- **Early Hip Hop**: **Looping and cutting** instrumental breaks, focusing on maintaining recognizable rhythmic elements with drum beats.

{{% note %}}
Musique concrète aimed to alter the original sounds to be unrecognizable, while hip hop preserved their musicality to create rhythmic patterns.

### Intent & Cultural Context

- **Musique Concrète**: Avant-garde, experimental, often for academic audiences, aiming to **challenge traditional definitions of music**.
- **Early Hip Hop**: Used sampling to **innovate within popular music**, appealing to street culture, DJs, and the party scene.

{{% note %}}
While musique concrète was focused on sound experimentation, hip hop used sampling to create new forms of accessible, rhythm-driven music.

### Technology

- **Musique Concrète**: **Analog tape machines**, manually cutting and splicing tape to manipulate sound.
- **Early Hip Hop**: **Digital samplers** like the Akai MPC allowed faster, easier manipulation and looping of sounds.

{{% note %}}
Hip hop sampling benefited from digital samplers, making the process more efficient than the labor-intensive tape splicing of musique concrète.

## The Kraftwerk Connection

- **Kraftwerk**, a German electronic music group, was influenced by avant-garde techniques, including some elements of **musique concrète**.
- **Afrika Bambaataa** famously sampled Kraftwerk in his pioneering hip hop track **"Planet Rock"** (1982).

{{% note %}}
Kraftwerk's influence demonstrates how early electronic and experimental music practices (including techniques developed by musique concrète) indirectly impacted the evolution of hip hop sampling.
