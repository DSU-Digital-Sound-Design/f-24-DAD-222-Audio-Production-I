title: "Final Project"
---

####  Project Goals:

- **Personal Creative Expression:** Encourage students to explore and express their unique artistic identity through their projects.
- **Technique Application:** Ensure students apply a variety of techniques learned during the course to manifest their creative vision.
- **Artistic Development:** Foster the growth of each student's distinctive voice and style as an emerging artist.

#### Project Overview:

Compose a **3-5-minute audio piece** that embodies your identity as an artist. Your creation should integrate at least two techniques discussed during the semester. These could include:

- **Studio Recording:** Incorporate recordings of instruments or voice.
  - Utilize these recordings directly in your project.
  - Alternatively, create samples from these recordings.
- **Audio Effects:** Employ various audio effects to enhance your composition.
- **Percussion with Sitalia:** Integrate MIDI drums or percussion.
- **Vital Synth Usage:** Incorporate sounds created with the Vital Synth.

**Alternative Projects:** If musical composition is not your preference, submit a proposal for an alternative project such as a podcast, sound design piece, or another audio format that showcases your learnings.

**Technique Integration:** While not all techniques must be central to your project, each should be incorporated in some capacity. For instance, studio recordings can be layered with MIDI drums and synthesized sounds to achieve a more authentic feel.

**Rule on Loops:** You may include one or two loops, provided they are significantly altered using effects or other methods to become your own. This same rule holds for other plugins where you use presets, such as Spitfire LABS. 

**Stylistic Freedom:** Feel free to explore any genre, such as techno, vaporware/wave, drill-core, etc. Incorporating a video is also welcome.

> **Presentation:** Projects will be presented during the final exam slot on December 13th, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Attendance is mandatory; failure to attend will result in failing the exam.

#### Deliverables:

- **Consolidated Project File:** Submit the complete project file used for your composition.
- **Rendered Master Track:** Provide a final rendered version of your audio piece.
- **Reflective Essay:** Submit a one-page reflection that includes:
  - **Influences:** Discuss the artists or works that influenced your composition. How does your piece differ from these influences?
  - **Creative Process:** Detail the steps you took, challenges faced, and solutions devised during the project's creation.
  - **Future Endeavors:** Share potential future projects or how you might further develop the skills acquired in this course.

#### Grading Criteria:

- **Technique Understanding:** Demonstrate proficiency in the techniques taught throughout the semester.
- **Artistic Voice Development:** Exhibit the growth of your unique artistic voice.
- **Creativity and Effort:** Show the level of originality and dedication invested in your project.
