title: "Project 4: Beatmaking"
---

**Objective:**\
Create a **16-32 measure** musical composition using samples from multiple sources. Each category listed below will represent one track, with an instance of the Sitala sampler for each track. This project can be a reimagining of your loop project, but with new samples.

### **Requirements:**

- The project must contain at least **four tracks**, each using only MIDI information to trigger Sitala.
- Download the samples using a YouTube downloader, such as [YT1s.com](https://yt1s.com/en629).
- After downloading, select and render the portion of the track you wish to use, then open it in Sitala.
- Use the production techniques we've covered in class, such as EQ, compression, reverb, and delay, to enhance your project.
- Feel free to manipulate your samples in creative ways beyond just EQ and compression. You can use techniques like **time-stretching, reversing, pitch-shifting**, or other effects to make the samples your own.
- Optionally, challenge yourself to explore a **new genre** or blend multiple genres for this project. This could help expand your musical creativity and push your boundaries.

### **Track Categories:**

**Drum Loop:**\
   Use a drum loop from a classic breakbeat, such as *"Amen, Brother"* by The Winstons. This will serve as the rhythmic foundation of your composition.

   - Example: [Drum Breaks (Most Used) on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/song-tag/Drum%20Breaks%20%28Most%20Used%29/)

**Chordal Hits:**\
   Find a sample or loop of a chordal instrument (e.g., piano or guitar).

   - Examples: [Piano Samples on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/song-tag/Piano/) | [Johannes Brahms Samples on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Johannes-Brahms/)

**Vocal Sample:**\
   Use a short vocal phrase or hit to add a melodic or rhythmic element.

   - Examples:
     - [Mariah Carey Samples on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Mariah-Carey/)
     - [Lyn Collins - ](https://www.whosampled.com/Lyn-Collins/Think-\(About-It\)/)[*Think (About It)*](https://www.whosampled.com/Lyn-Collins/Think-\(About-It\)/)[ on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Lyn-Collins/Think-\(About-It\)/)
     - [Burial's ](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)*[Archangel](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)*[ sampling Ray J's ](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)*[One Wish](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)*[ on WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)

**Found Sounds:**\
   Source a sample from [Freesound.org](http://freesound.org) to add texture or "ear candy" to your composition. This could include vinyl noise, ambient field recordings, or other short sounds. Optionally, create your own found sound using a Zoom recorder or your phone.

> **Note:** In addition to the four MIDI-triggered tracks, you may use **one** audio loop if you wish.

### **Submission Instructions:**

Submit to D2L the following:

- A compressed folder containing all project files, including audio files and any samples used.
- A rendered audio file of your final master mix.

| **Overall Assessment** | **Points** | **Letter Grade** | **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Excellent**          | 41-45      | A (90-100)       | The composition is highly original and well-produced. Track selection, arrangement, MIDI sequencing, sample usage, and production techniques (EQ, compression, reverb, delay) are of exceptional quality, resulting in a polished final mix. |
| **Good**               | 36-40      | B (80-89)        | The composition is creative and well-produced. Track selection, arrangement, MIDI sequencing, sample usage, and production techniques are of a high standard, contributing to a cohesive and engaging project.                               |
| **Fair**               | 31-35      | C (70-79)        | The composition meets the basic project requirements. Track selection, arrangement, MIDI sequencing, and production techniques are satisfactory, though there may be some inconsistencies in sound quality or overall production.            |
| **Poor**               | 26-30      | D (60-69)        | The composition does not fully meet the project requirements. Track selection, arrangement, MIDI sequencing, sample usage, and production techniques are below the expected standard, resulting in a subpar final mix.                       |
| **Failing**            | Below 26   | F (Below 60)     | The composition does not meet the project requirements. Track selection, arrangement, MIDI sequencing, and production techniques are all of very poor quality, significantly impacting the overall sound and composition.                    |
